## Note
Camera is broken so use W key + mouse to navigate through the scene

Press Alt + f4 to terminate the program. 
Esc key works as well but the program would still be running in the background and you wouldn't be able to recompile

Built using x86_64-w64-mingw32 compiler on Windows
Out.exe on the ProgEx1 folder is the latest compilation up to date with the Main.cpp code
